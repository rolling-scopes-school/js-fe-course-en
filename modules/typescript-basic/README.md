## Module Description

Learning **TypeScript** can be quite beneficial for front-end developers for several reasons:

1. **Static Typing**: TypeScript introduces static types to JavaScript, which catch potential issues at compile-time that
would otherwise only be caught at run-time in plain JavaScript. This is beneficial for preventing bugs and reducing debugging time.

2. **Enhanced Tooling**: TypeScript's static typing leads to improved autocompletion, navigation features, and more in 
popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code. This results in more effective coding and 
reduces the likelihood of errors.

3. **Great for Large Codebases**: TypeScript offers features like modules, namespaces, and interfaces that make it easier 
to organize and manage large codebases. This is one of the key reasons why large organizations like Microsoft, Google, 
and Airbnb use TypeScript.

4. **Better Readability**: By providing explicit information about an object's properties (via interfaces), TypeScript makes 
code more descriptive and easier to read, which is particularly beneficial in team settings.

5. **Future JavaScript Features**: TypeScript offers support for features from future standards of JavaScript like decorators 
and async/await, which are finalized and stable within TypeScript, even if theyâ€™re still experimental in JavaScript.

6. **Popularity and Demand**: TypeScript is gaining popularity in the industry and there is a growing demand for developers 
who know TypeScript, especially for larger projects and for projects involving Angular, which is built with TypeScript.

By learning TypeScript, front-end developers can write more reliable, maintainable and scalable JavaScript code.

This module introduces students to TypeScript Basics. It aims to provide an in-depth understanding of key concepts such as reading and writing TypeScript code, describing variables with primitive data types, and exploring essential TypeScript constructs like interface, type, and more.
The module covers a range of topics from fundamental TypeScript skills to theoretical aspects, fostering a solid understanding of the basics of TypeScript among students.
