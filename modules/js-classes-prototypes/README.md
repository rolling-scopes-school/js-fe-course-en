## Module Description

**Classes and prototypes** are foundational concepts in JavaScript, and understanding them is crucial for a JavaScript 
developer for the following reasons:

1. **Prototypal Inheritance**: JavaScript is a prototypal-based language. Each object has a link to a prototype object. 
Understanding this concept helps developers to manipulate object properties and methods more effectively.

2. **Code Structure**: Classes in JavaScript provide a way to define "blueprints" for creating similar objects. They make 
the code structure more manageable, especially when dealing with complex programs with multiple objects.

3. **Object Creation**: Knowing classes and prototypes is crucial in JavaScript for object creation and defining object 
behavior. You can create multiple objects with shared behavior using both concepts.

4. **Modern Frameworks/Libraries**: Modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js use classes 
extensively. Without a clear understanding of classes, it becomes challenging to use these tools effectively.

5. **Performance**: Manipulating prototypes can directly impact the performance of your JavaScript code. It is therefore 
crucial to understand this if you are trying to improve or optimize your code.

6. **ES6 and Beyond**: Classes were formally introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) as syntactic sugar over prototypes, 
combining declaration and inheritance syntax. Understanding these features is critical for writing modern JavaScript.

Overall, understanding classes and prototypes is essential to write efficient, maintainable, and modern JavaScript code.

**Inheritance** is a fundamental concept in many programming languages, including JavaScript, and offers several benefits:

1. **Code Reusability**: Inheritance allows developers to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior
defined in other classes. This means developers can use methods and fields already defined, reducing code duplication.

2. **Organization**: It provides a way to structure your code in an organized and logical way. A well-structured codebase is 
easier to understand, maintain, and expand.

3. **Abstraction**: Inheritance can help hide complex implementations behind a simple interface. It defines a protocol for 
classes to follow, which leads to a consistent and predictable API.

4. **Polymorphism**: Inheritance is a requisite for another important object-oriented concept — polymorphism. It allows methods
in the child class to have the same name as methods in the parent class but with different implementations.

5. **Understanding Frameworks**: Many JavaScript frameworks use classical inheritance, so understanding it can help you get up 
to speed with these frameworks more quickly.

Understanding inheritance can lead to cleaner, more efficient, and modular code, and it's a crucial concept for any 
JavaScript developer to grasp.
